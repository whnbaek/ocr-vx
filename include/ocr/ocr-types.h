 * @brief Data block access modes
 *
 * These are the modes with which an EDT can access a data block. OCR currently
 * supports five modes:
 * - None: This is useful to convert a data-dependence into a control-dependence,
 *   when an EDT doesn't expect a datablock but it may be passed along the event.
 * - Read Only (RO): The EDT is stating that it will only read from the data block.
 *   In this mode, the runtime guarantees that the data block seen by the EDT
 *   is not modified by other concurrent EDTs (in other words, the data block
 *   does not change "under you". Any violation of the "no-write" contract
 *   by the program will result in undefined behavior
 *   (the write may or may not be visible to other EDTs depending on the
 *   implementation and specific runtime conditions).
 * - Non-coherent read (NCR): This mode is exactly the same as RO
 *   except that the runtime does not guarantee that the data block will
 *   not change.
 * - Read-write (RW) (default mode): The EDT is stating that it may
 *   or may not write to the data block. The user is responsible for
 *   synchronizing between EDTs that could potentially write to the same
 *   data block concurrently.
 * - Exclusive write (EW): The EDT requires that it be the only one accessing
 *   the data block. The runtime will not schedule any other EDT that accesses
 *   the same data block in EW or ITW mode concurrently.
 *   This can limit parallelism.
